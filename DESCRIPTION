Description: Explore, handle and export mitochondrial sequences of Helicini land snails. Contains updated data from Korábek et al. 2022 (Diversity 14(1), 24; https://doi.org/10.3390/d14010024). Includes functions for handling the data tailored to the data structure used, with separate file for each locus; data are organized around individual identifiers (see README.txt for detailed explanation of data structure, use export.Helicini()). Some functions may be more broadly useful. Functions use base R wherever possible. Some functions date back to my very beginnings with R and are not very elegant. In some future updates, 'ape' will hopefuly be used more to handle alignments to avoid large character vectors.
